I have a bachelor's degree. Currently, I work in the field of industrial electronics. I've been looking at programming my whole life and was afraid to start. But at some point, I decided it was time (at 30 years old, yes). This course is my first significant experience in programming, and I hope it won't be my last. So far, I like everything, it's very interesting, and I constantly want to improve my skills. I wish everyone good luck, don't give up, and you will succeed!`,

            Our team held a call the day before the end of the sprint. During this call, we reviewed
            the results, identified difficulties, and tried to find solutions. Every 2-3 days
            throughout the sprint, we also met to share our current progress.

            Sometimes, to find solutions to certain tasks, we organized code jams. It was a great
            experience because each of us participated in the coding process. We all had a positive
            experience.
